# Interview Prep Hub

Static website for freshers to practice company-wise mock interviews and timed MCQ exams.

- Open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder with any static server
- Edit `data/companies.json` to add companies, interview questions, and MCQs
- Scores and attempts are saved locally in `localStorage`

Structure:
- `index.html` — routes and containers
- `styles.css` — minimal UI
- `script.js` — routing, timers, scoring, history
- `data/companies.json` — content
